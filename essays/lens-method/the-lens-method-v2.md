# The Lens Method: Collaborative Authority in Content

*January 2026*

I didn't set out to develop yet another marketing method. I was just trying to solve a problem that kept showing up in my work.

As a writer in B2B marketing, my experience can only take me so far. I'm not an SEO practitioner running campaigns. I'm not a startup founder scaling a product. But my job is to write authoritatively about these things. To create content that helps readers do something better.

The easy path is desk research. Read what's already published, synthesize it, add some polish. But that content feels thin. Readers can tell when a writer is just rearranging information they found elsewhere.

The other path—the one I kept gravitating toward—was talking to people who actually do the work. Interview practitioners. Get the real stories, the specific numbers, the hard-won insights. Then use that material to make an argument.

But here's what I noticed: when you bring experts into your writing, you can either amplify their voice or lose yours. Most content does the latter. Quote roundups where the writer disappears. Interview transcripts with thin transitions. The expert becomes the authority; the writer becomes a conduit.

I wanted something different. A way to incorporate expertise without surrendering the narrative.

## The insight

Expert experience is raw light. It illuminates, but scatters without direction.

The writer provides the lens—deciding what matters, what connects, and what it means for a specific audience. Without the lens, expertise remains locked in the expert's context. Without expertise, the writer has nothing to focus.

**The person who identifies the pattern owns the pattern.**

An expert knows what they did. The writer knows why it matters to someone else.

## This isn't new

Non-fiction authors have done this forever. Malcolm Gladwell interviews hundreds of people for each book, then presents *his* argument using their stories as evidence. James Clear built *Atomic Habits* on research and practitioner insights, but the framework—the 1% improvement, the four laws—those are his synthesis. The experts provide proof; the author owns the thesis.

Journalists do something similar, but they defer authority. They report. They aim for objectivity. The story belongs to the facts, not the writer.

What I'm describing sits between these: you maintain your narrative, but you use experts to support it. You're not reporting what they said. You're building an argument and using their experience as proof.

Threading that needle requires skill. It's harder than either pure journalism or pure personal essay. But it produces something neither can: content with both credibility and voice.

## When it crystallized

In 2024 at Backlinko, AI search disrupted everything. Traditional SEO tactics were suddenly unproven. Nobody knew what worked anymore.

We had to figure it out together. Strategists, writers, editors collaborated on briefs, challenging each other's assumptions. Three or four people contributing their perspectives to a single piece. Then distilling all of that into one author speaking directly to a reader.

That's when I started finding language for what I'd been doing intuitively. The chaos forced clarity. When multiple voices need to become one, you have to get precise about who owns what.

I'd already been practicing this approach. Earlier, I wrote a piece on [information gain](https://backlinko.com/information-gain). I interviewed three content leaders—Caroline Gilbert at Angi, Nisha Vora at Rainbow Plant Life, Sam Balter at Wistia. Each had built something remarkable. Each had insights that would make my argument stronger.

But here's the thing: Caroline didn't call her approach "proprietary data plus reader empathy." That was my pattern. I named what she was doing. I connected her work to the other practitioners. I built the argument about what makes content defensible.

Could she have written that article herself? No. She knew her own experience, but not the pattern across practitioners. That pattern—that synthesis—was mine.

## The ownership test

This is how I now evaluate every piece of content that incorporates expert input:

**Could the expert have written this themselves?**

If yes, you're a conduit. Authority flows to them.

If no, you're the author. You brought a frame, a synthesis, an audience understanding they don't have.

Most content fails this test. The writer collects quotes, arranges them nicely, and disappears. The experts get the credibility. The writer gets... a byline.

The Lens Method inverts this. The experts provide evidence; the writer provides meaning.

## What makes authority stay with the writer

**Thesis before interview.** Come with a question or hypothesis. The interview serves your inquiry, not the expert's agenda. For Information Gain, I knew I wanted to explore what makes content defensible before I identified who to talk to. The thesis shaped which experts I chose and which questions I asked.

**Qualification and selection.** Choosing who to interview is itself an act of authority. You're saying: "This person's experience matters for what I'm trying to teach." This phase is underestimated. I researched 10+ candidates to find the three who had both strong-performing content and insights that would prove my argument.

**Pattern naming.** The expert might not name what they're doing. When you identify and name the pattern, you own it. That naming is an act of authorship.

**The contextual layer.** Add micro-translations throughout: "Here's what this means for you." Connect expert experience to tools and contexts your reader can use. The expert doesn't know your audience; you do.

**Selective attribution.** Not everything the expert says makes the piece. You choose which insights to elevate, which quotes to feature. Caroline said many things; I chose "How do you make something really hard for your competition to replicate?" because it crystallized the argument.

**Accountability.** Your name is on the piece. If something is wrong, you're responsible. That accountability is part of what makes it authored work.

## The practical reality

This method requires relationship management.

Finding subject matter experts. Getting them to respond. Figuring out the best way for them to share information—a written response, a video, a call. All viable, but each requires coordination.

I've built Notion databases for contact management. Tracking who I've reached out to, who's responded, where they are in contributing to a piece. It's a CRM for content creation.

The outreach itself is a skill. "Can I interview you for an article?" is weak. "I'm writing about X and your work on Y is one of the best examples I've found"—that flatters and specifies. It tells the expert why they were chosen.

This friction is a feature. It's hard to do well, which means most writers won't do it. The difficulty creates a moat.

## Why it matters now

The bar for credibility keeps rising. Readers are skeptical of single-voice authority ("who is this person to tell me?"), pure expert content ("is this just self-promotion?"), and AI-generated synthesis ("where's the real experience?").

The Lens Method threads the needle: real expertise from practitioners, shaped by a writer who takes responsibility for making it useful.

This type of content gets shared. It gets featured in newsletters. It leads to conference invitations. The Information Gain article did exactly that—because it demonstrated depth in a way that desk research can't replicate.

## How to apply it

**Before the interview:**
- What's your thesis or hypothesis?
- Why this expert? What do they prove?
- What specific questions will yield usable material?

**During the interview:**
- Ask for stories, not opinions
- Ask "walk me through how you did this"
- Listen for patterns they haven't articulated
- Note specific numbers, timeframes, results

**After the interview:**
- What's the pattern across this expert and others?
- What should you name that they didn't name?
- What context does your audience need that the expert doesn't provide?

**In the writing:**
- Lead with the thesis, not the expert
- Use expert material as proof, not as structure
- Add the contextual layer throughout
- Make the "so what" explicit

## The compounding effect

Each article builds assets for the next. Expert relationships that can be tapped again. A growing network of practitioners in your space. Credibility that makes outreach easier. A body of work that demonstrates your editorial perspective.

The method gets easier the more you use it. The first outreach is hard. The tenth is a warm email to someone who already knows your work.
